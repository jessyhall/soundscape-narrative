what i’ve included here is my first draft of my soundscape, with 3 layers of audio—someone walking through a forest, a creek running, and the sound of birds chirping, to emulate the sound of walking through schenley park. i also have my mp3 file of my first draft and the screenshot(s) of my audacity screen. something i couldn't figure out is i recorded a sound on my phone, airdropped it to my computer, but it wouldn't open in audacity bc it's not the right file type but i don't know how to change it.
