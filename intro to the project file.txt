For this soundscape I wanted to emulate the sounds of going on a walk through Oakland and Schenley Park. I recorded an audio of myself closing and locking my front door, and then with downloaded sounds I put together walking on pavement, which would be from my house to the park, walking through a forest sound, which represents going through the Park itself, then back to pavement until the end, where I'd be returning to my house. I also included sounds of birds chirping and creeks flowing, to add to the effect of being out in nature. I used the fade in and fade out effects a few times so that the transitions between the sounds weren't super choppy and so that everything flowed together pretty well.
